We apply any payments made in the following order:\n• to reduce sums shown on the most recent monthly statement, according to their interest rates, with the highest rate paid first; and\n• if any payment exceeds the most recent monthly statement balance, the excess will then be applied to reduce sums charged to the Card but not yet shown on any monthly statement. This is also done according to interest rates, with the highest interest rate paid first. If parts of either of the balances referred to above have the same interest rate, sums on which interest is charged on interest will reduce first.\nWe may give written notice allowing the customer not to make a minimum payment.

A monthly statement will explain how to make payments.\nWe may not issue a monthly statement if the balance is zero and there have been no entries since the previous monthly statement.\nThe minimum payment must be made each month from a business account in the customers' name.\nThe minimum payment will be either:\n(i) the greater of £5 or 5% of the full amount\noutstanding;\n(ii) the full amount, where the sum outstanding is\nless than £5; or\n(iii) subject to any notice required by law, the full outstanding balance if: we believe that the card is being used or might be used in breach of the agreement or in an unauthorised or fraudulent manner; or as a result of a change in the way you operate your account or in your financial circumstances (including missing payments), we reasonably believe that you may have difficulty in meeting your commitments\n\nAny overdue amounts, which will be included in the total amount required to pay, are payable immediately. When we ask, immediate payment is required on any amount you owe over the  Business Credit Limit.\nWe encourage customers to pay more than the minimum amount each month. As they will clear their balance more quickly and pay less interest. \nCustomers must not make payments to their Card that creates a positive balance on your account.
