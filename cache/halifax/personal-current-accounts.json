When calculating the daily overdraft fee, we will only use every full £7 you have borrowed, so if you borrow less than £7 you won’t be charged. \n\nDaily Charging\nInstead of paying all fees in one go each month, any fees will be charged at the end of each day you use your overdraft – so you’ll pay for what you borrow on the day you borrow it. This will help you keep track of how much your overdraft costs you.\n\nIf you go over your limit\nSo all your payments are made, it’s important you manage your account within your planned overdraft limit. If you don’t have enough money in your account or you reach your limit, you may not be able to make any more payments. If a payment takes you over your limit or we stop it, you won’t be charged."

When calculating the daily overdraft fee, we will only use every full £7 you have borrowed, so if you borrow less than £7 you won’t be charged. \n\nDaily Charging\nInstead of paying all fees in one go each month, any fees will be charged at the end of each day you use your overdraft – so you’ll pay for what you borrow on the day you borrow it. This will help you keep track of how much your overdraft costs you.\n\nIf you go over your limit\nSo all your payments are made, it’s important you manage your account within your planned overdraft limit. If you don’t have enough money in your account or you reach your limit, you may not be able to make any more payments. If a payment takes you over your limit or we stop it, you won’t be charged."
