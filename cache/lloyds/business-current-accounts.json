It takes into account the interest rate you are charged as a result and how often it’s charged – in this case interest is calculated daily and charged monthly. It then takes into account the effect of compounding – charging interest on interest – on your debt. Charges for unarranged overdrafts are charged separately",
                              "The representative EAR is an illustration of the rate that the majority of customers will receive. If an overdraft is described as having a particular representative EAR, then we expect to offer that rate or better to at least 51% of the applicants we accept. Other customers may get a different rate based on their individual circumstances. Our representative EAR applies to all unsecured overdrafts with a borrowing amount of up to £25,000 for businesses with a turnover from £1 million of up to £25 million. This figure is not necessarily the rate you will be receiving and is for illustrative purposes only.” "
