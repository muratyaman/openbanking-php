                    "When you travel abroad on business, it's good to know you're covered for almost any eventuality. But travel insurance can be expensive. So why not save money with our enhanced travel insurance option, which is included in the annual fee of £100 per year for your first card, and then just £75 per card, per year for additional cards. It comes with: 14.9% Purchase Interest Rate, an initial 6-months interest free purchase period, up to 56 days interest free after the initial 6 month period. To keep your 0% rate, just make sure you stay within your credit limit and make at least your minimum payment on time each month. It's also important that you clear your balance in full after the interest-free period ends, or you'll be charged interest. 0.5% cashback on purchases, £400 max per year. Save 2% on foreign exchange fees. Membership of Priority Pass VIP Airport lounge with first two visits included per year. Additional visits £15 each. Plus insurances and added protection for your business - Enhanced Travel, Cardholder Misuse and Purchase Protection. Limitations and exclustions apply"
