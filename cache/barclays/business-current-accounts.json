The EAR does not include any fees or charges which apply to your overdraft.  It also does not take account of any future Base Rate changes. Representative EAR - Representative Effective Annual Rate  is the advertised rate (or a lower rate) we reasonably expect at least 51% of customers who are accepted for and enter into the overdraft agreement as a result of the advertising or marketing will get.
